        <strong>A recipe with simple ingredients perfect for the holidays!</strong>
        <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Unsalted Butter (2 cups)</li>
            <li>White Sugar (2 cups)</li>
            <li>Salt (1/4 teaspoon)</li>
            <li>Semisweet Chocolate Chips (2 cups)</li>
            <li>Finely Chopped Almonds (1 cup, can be substituted with walnuts or pecans, if desired)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><h2>Steps</h2></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine butter, sugar, and salt in a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat; stir constantly in one direction until butter is melted, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, line a 9x13-inch baking dish with a sheet of parchment paper, letting it overhang two sides of the dish.</li>
            <li>Once the butter has melted, stop stirring and bring mixture to a boil. Once boiling, cook, stirring only 2 to 3 times, until it turns a dark amber color and the temperature reaches 285 degrees F (137 degrees C) on a candy thermometer, 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Immediately pour toffee into the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle chocolate chips on top and let sit until they soften, 1 to 2 minutes. Use a spatula to spread softened chocolate into a thin, even layer. Sprinkle nuts over the chocolate and press down slightly; wearing a plastic bag over your hand will minimize the mess.</li>
            <li>Place toffee in the refrigerator until set, about 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Lift hardened toffee out of the baking dish with the parchment paper. Break into pieces and store in an airtight container.</li>
        </ol>
