            <li>Flour (2 tablespoons)</li>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place a baking sheet on an oven rack.</li>
            <li>Stir sugar, flour, and cinnamon together in a small bowl until well combined. Cut butter into small pieces; divide into two equal piles.</li>
            <li>Roll out pastry to an 11- or 12-inch circle; press into a 9-inch pie pan. Roll out top crust and set aside.</li>
            <li>Place sliced apples into a large bowl. Pour sugar mixture over top and add 1/2 of the butter pieces. Toss apples until thoroughly coated. Pour into the pastry-lined pie pan.</li>
            <li>Dot apples with remaining butter. Place second pastry on top. Seal edges and cut steam vents in top crust.</li>
            <li>Set pie on the baking sheet in the preheated oven. Bake until filling is bubbly and crust is golden brown, 50 minutes to 1 hour.</li>
